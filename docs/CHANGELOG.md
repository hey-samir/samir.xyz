# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Versioning Methodology

This project uses a custom implementation of Semantic Versioning:
- **Major versions (X.0.0)**: Dictated by user requirement changes or significant architectural shifts
- **Minor versions (0.X.0)**: Represent new chat/interaction cycles with the AI assistant
- **Patch versions (0.0.X)**: Individual commits within a single chat session

## [8.3.0] - 2025-04-04

### Navbar Brand Wordmark Fix

- **Enhanced Navbar Brand Wordmark Styling**
  - Fixed persistent issue with "Hey - I'm Samir" text not appearing in white in dark mode
  - Implemented multiple styling approaches for maximum browser compatibility
  - Created direct DOM styling in useEffect hook for guaranteed wordmark styling
  - Added !important flags for this specific use case to override any conflicting styles
  - Implemented proper hover effects for the brand wordmark consistent with our design system

### Advanced CSS Handling

- **Improved CSS Specificity Strategies**
  - Created specialized classes (`brand-wordmark`, `brand-wordmark-text`) for targeted styling
  - Employed higher specificity selectors with multiple class combinations
  - Implemented JavaScript-enhanced styling to ensure consistency across all browsers
  - Added defensive CSS to handle edge cases in various rendering environments

## [8.2.0] - 2025-04-04

### Footer Consistency & Styling Improvements

- **Enhanced Footer Styling**
  - Standardized purple theme colors in footer to match site-wide color scheme
  - Improved footer link styling to be consistent with other page links
  - Enhanced dark mode footer with proper ultra-deep purple background (#12022e)
  - Added subtle purple glow effect to footer in dark mode for visual consistency

### Link Styling Standards

- **Standardized Link Styling**
  - Implemented consistent link styles across all components (navbar, footer, content)
  - Created hover effects with proper contrast using purple-300 to purple-200 transition
  - Removed all hardcoded color values in favor of theme-based color system
  - Fixed link contrast issues to ensure proper accessibility

## [8.1.0] - 2025-04-04

### Layout & Styling Improvements

- **Improved Portfolio Page Layout**
  - Changed KPI layout to display 2 rows of 4 KPIs instead of 4 rows of 2 KPIs for better space utilization
  - Increased max-width of portfolio containers from 800px to 1100px for better widescreen presentation
  - Created responsive portfolio grid (1-column mobile, 2-columns standard, 3-columns widescreen)
  - Improved card presentation with consistent spacing and dimensions

- **Navbar & Navigation Improvements**
  - Fixed navbar wordmark color to white for better contrast in dark mode
  - Adjusted spacing between navbar and content with optimal padding (py-8 mt-0)

## [8.0.0] - 2025-04-04

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Removed all `!important` flags** - Eliminated all `!important` CSS flags which were causing specificity issues and making the stylesheet harder to maintain. Proper CSS hierarchy and specificity should always be used instead of forcing styles with `!important`.

- **Replaced inline styles with Tailwind classes** - Converted all inline style attributes to Tailwind utility classes for better consistency and maintainability. Inline styles should be avoided as they make the code harder to maintain and override.

- **Standardized globals.css structure** - Reorganized global CSS file to follow best practices:
  - Used `@layer components` for component-specific styles
  - Defined CSS variables in `:root` for consistent theming
  - Implemented dark mode styles using proper class selectors

- **Improved component organization** - Component-specific styles now live with their respective components while truly global styles remain in globals.css.

### Documentation

- **Enhanced Code Quality Guidelines** - Added comprehensive Code Quality Best Practices section to README.md
- **Added Law of AI #6** - Updated the Five Laws of AI with a 6th law focused on code quality and avoiding shortcuts
- **Expanded Project Cleanup Notes** - Added CSS and Styling Improvements section to document our recent changes

### Coding Best Practices

This project strictly adheres to the following coding principles:

1. **No coding shortcuts that compromise quality** - Never use bad coding practices to solve a problem quickly. Quality is never sacrificed for speed.

2. **No `!important` flags** - CSS should be structured with proper specificity hierarchies, not forced overrides.

3. **No inline styles** - Styles should be managed through the design system (Tailwind) or component-specific stylesheets.

4. **Proper separation of concerns** - Keep component logic, styling, and markup appropriately separated.

5. **Consistent theming** - Use the established theming system rather than hardcoding colors or creating one-off solutions.

6. **Mobile-first responsive design** - Always ensure components work across all screen sizes.

7. **Accessibility standards** - Maintain proper accessibility practices throughout the codebase.

8. **Performance optimization** - Follow best practices for optimizing rendering and reducing unnecessary re-renders.

These principles ensure the codebase remains maintainable, scalable, and of high quality for current and future developers.
