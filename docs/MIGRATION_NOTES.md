# Portfolio Website Migration Notes

## Project Migration Summary

This project was originally built with Next.js but encountered persistent TypeScript issues that caused the application to fail. After multiple attempts to fix these issues, we migrated to a more stable solution using static HTML pages served by a lightweight Node.js server.

## Current Implementation

- **Architecture**: Static HTML pages with shared CSS styling
- **Server**: Simple Node.js static file server (static-server.js)
- **Pages**:
  - Home (index.html)
  - Portfolio (portfolio.html)
  - Profile/About (profile.html)
  - Ventures (ventures.html)

## Benefits of the Current Approach

1. **Stability**: No TypeScript compilation errors or React runtime issues
2. **Performance**: Faster page loads with static HTML 
3. **Simplicity**: Easy to maintain and update
4. **Compatibility**: Works in all browsers without JavaScript requirements

## Future Enhancements

If you decide to migrate back to a React-based solution in the future, consider:

1. **Remix**: A React framework with better TypeScript compatibility
2. **Astro**: A modern static site generator that allows React components with less runtime overhead
3. **Vite + React**: A faster build system with React that may avoid the issues encountered with Next.js

## How to Modify Content

To update the website content:

1. Edit the HTML files directly in the `/public` directory
2. Modify styles in `/public/styles/global.css`
3. Add new pages by creating new HTML files and updating the navigation links in each page

## Development Workflow

To run the development server:
```
bun static-server.js
```

The server will automatically watch for changes and serve the updated files.
