### Naming Conventions

The project follows consistent naming conventions for better readability and maintenance:

- **Files and Directories**: Uses `kebab-case` for script files and config files (e.g., `organize-assets.sh`)
- **React Components**: Uses `PascalCase` for component names and their files (e.g., `ClientWrapper.tsx`)
- **React Pages**: Follows Next.js naming convention with lowercase `page.tsx` in directories representing routes
- **CSS and Style Files**: Uses `kebab-case` (e.g., `globals.css`)
- **Configuration Files**: Uses standard naming with appropriate extensions (e.g., `next.config.js`, `tailwind.config.cjs`)
- **Utility Scripts**: Uses `kebab-case` with descriptive prefixes (e.g., `organize-assets.sh`)

## Configuration

### Core Configuration

- **next.config.js** - Main Next.js configuration
  - Contains settings for image optimization, CORS headers, and development environment
  - Configures cross-origin settings for Replit
  - Sets cache headers for static assets

### Styling Configuration

  - Defines custom colors, animation, keyframes, and responsive breakpoints
  - Includes container configurations
  - Sets up typography and animation plugins

- **postcss.config.cjs** - PostCSS configuration
  - Configures Tailwind CSS PostCSS plugin with optimized settings
  - Sets up autoprefixer for better browser compatibility

### Asset Configuration

- **src/config/paths.ts** - Centralizes path configurations for consistent asset references
- **tools/scripts/organize-assets.sh** - Script for normalizing and organizing image assets

### Configuration Best Practices

1. **Keep it Simple**: Avoid creating multiple configuration files for the same tool
2. **Centralize Settings**: Use a single source of truth for configuration values
3. **Document Changes**: Add comments for complex configuration options
4. **Follow Official Patterns**: Adhere to Next.js and Tailwind CSS recommended patterns
5. **Performance Optimization**: Include specific performance enhancements in the configuration

## Development Tools & Scripts

### organize-assets.sh

Located in `tools/scripts/organize-assets.sh`, this script handles asset organization and normalization:

- **Purpose**: Ensures consistent image asset locations and naming conventions
- **When it runs**: Automatically executed during the `start.sh` startup process
- **What it does**:
  1. Creates necessary directories for assets
  2. Copies images from `attached_assets` to `public/attached_assets`
  3. Normalizes venture logos with consistent naming
  4. Places logos in `public/logos/ventures` with standardized filenames

### check-ventures.sh

Located in `tools/check-ventures.sh`, this script verifies venture data:

- **Purpose**: Ensures venture images and data are properly loaded
- **When to use**: Run manually for debugging venture data
- **What it does**: Checks for missing venture images and reports any issues

### cleanup-test-dirs.sh

Located in `tools/scripts/cleanup-test-dirs.sh`, this script cleans up test directories:

- **Purpose**: Safely removes or archives test and debug directories
- **When to use**: During codebase cleanup to improve maintainability
- **What it does**: Moves test directories to a backup location for reference

### Archived Scripts

The `tools/archive` directory contains previous scripts that have been preserved for reference but should not be used:

- `check-portfolio-styles.js` - Replaced by improved Tailwind configuration
- `test-grid-with-fetch.js` - No longer needed with current architecture
- `update-navbar-shadows.js` - Functionality now handled by proper CSS

### Best Practices for Scripts

1. **Script Organization**: Keep all utility scripts in the `tools` directory
2. **Documentation**: Document purpose and usage for all scripts
3. **Maintenance**: Archive rather than delete scripts that might be useful for reference
4. **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks through the startup process
5. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling and logging in scripts

## Development Guidelines

### Component Structure

- Keep components simple and focused on a single responsibility
- Use the ClientWrapper for client-side only components
- Prefer server components when possible
- Follow established component patterns for consistency

### Styling Approach

- Use Tailwind CSS utilities for styling components
- Avoid inline styles or custom CSS when possible
- Follow the project's design system for consistency
- Maintain responsive design throughout the application

### Performance Optimization

- Utilize Next.js image optimization
- Implement proper code splitting
- Minimize client-side JavaScript
- Follow asset optimization best practices

### Error Handling

- Use proper error boundaries to catch and display errors
- Implement informative error messages for better debugging
- Avoid error suppression in favor of proper error handling
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

### Code Quality Best Practices

- **No shortcuts that compromise quality** - Never use bad coding practices to solve problems quickly. Quality must never be sacrificed for speed.
  
- **No `!important` flags in CSS** - CSS should be structured with proper specificity hierarchies, not forced with `!important` flags which create maintenance problems.
  
- **No inline styles** - All styling should be managed through Tailwind utility classes or component-specific stylesheets, never with inline style attributes.
  
- **Consistent component architecture** - All components should follow the same patterns and architecture for maintainability.
  
- **Proper separation of concerns** - Keep component logic, styling, and markup appropriately separated following industry best practices.
  
- **10x engineer mindset** - Write clean, optimized, maintainable code that follows all industry best practices, enabling future developers to easily understand and extend the codebase.
  
- **Global vs. component-specific styles** - Keep global styles (in globals.css) truly global, with component-specific styles contained within their respective component files.
  
- **Accessibility standards** - Maintain proper accessibility practices throughout the codebase including proper semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation support.

## Artificial Intelligence Model Instructions

### Model Context

When working with this codebase, please adhere to these best practices:

1. **Runtime Environment**: Always use Bun runtime for optimal performance in the Replit environment. Do not substitute with Node.js.

2. **Source Map Configuration**: Source maps must remain disabled to prevent client-side hydration errors. This configuration exists in `next.config.js` and environment variables in `start.sh`.

3. **Component Structure**: The application uses a specialized `ClientWrapper` component architecture to safely handle client-side hydration issues in the Replit environment.

4. **Next.js Configuration**: The `next.config.js` file contains specific Turbopack and webpack configurations designed for Replit compatibility.

5. **Rendering Strategy**: Use server-side rendering when possible, with client-side hydration handled through dedicated wrapper components.

### Seven Laws of Artificial Intelligence

1. You will never delete more than one file at a time without asking for explicit permission from the user.

2. You will focus on the issue that the user explicitly asks you to focus on and will not attempt to solve other issues unless instructed by the user.

3. You will provide a concrete approach and plan for each user interaction thread. You will solve issues iteratively and check in with the user for guidance and to explain what you are doing on a periodic basis.

4. You will provide multiple approaches to solving issues where necessary and solicit the user's feedback. You will provide your recommendation for best approach.

5. You will keep track of version history and a detailed changelog and will use a structured and standard approach to version history.

6. You will always prioritize code quality and follow best practices, never implementing shortcuts or "hacky" solutions even when they might seem faster. Quality code is maintainable code; use proper CSS specificity instead of `!important`, Tailwind classes instead of inline styles, and appropriate component architecture rather than quick fixes.

7. You will implement solutions with a systems-thinking approach that considers long-term maintainability and scalability. This includes:
   - Using centralized configuration and avoiding duplication of code or assets
   - Creating proper abstractions rather than copy-pasting similar code
   - Ensuring backward compatibility when refactoring
   - Addressing the root cause of issues rather than symptoms
   - Testing changes thoroughly before considering work complete
   - Documenting architectural decisions and their implications
   - Never introducing technical debt knowingly — always factor in the time to do things properly

## Building and Running

The application is configured to run automatically through the "Start application" workflow, which executes `./start.sh`.

```bash
# View application version
cat version.json

# Manual start (if needed)
./start.sh
```

The application will be available at the designated Replit URL or locally at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
