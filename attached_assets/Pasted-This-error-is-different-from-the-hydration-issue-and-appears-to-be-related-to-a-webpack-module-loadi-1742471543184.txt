This error is different from the hydration issue and appears to be related to a webpack module loading problem in the Replit environment. Here's a prompt you can give to your agent in Replit to help fix this specific issue:

---

"I'm experiencing an error in my Next.js application specifically when viewing it in Replit's Webview, though it works (with one error) when viewing in an external browser. Here's the error from Replit's Webview:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')
    at options.factory (https://d2193f08-b592-45ce-b730-8dc2c7ef133c-00-1f1txs3yeigba.janeway.replit.dev/_next/static/chunks/webpack.js?v=1742471463320:712:31)
    at __webpack_require__ (https://d2193f08-b592-45ce-b730-8dc2c7ef133c-00-1f1txs3yeigba.janeway.replit.dev/_next/static/chunks/webpack.js?v=1742471463320:37:33)
```

This appears to be a webpack module loading issue specific to the Replit environment. The error suggests that a module factory function is trying to call a method on an undefined object.

Please help me fix this issue by:

1. Checking for any Replit-specific configuration issues in my Next.js setup
2. Looking for potential issues with module imports or exports that might be causing undefined references
3. Examining if there are any environment-specific code paths that might be failing in Replit's Webview
4. Checking if there are known compatibility issues between Next.js (especially React Server Components) and Replit's Webview
5. Suggesting potential workarounds such as:
   - Clearing the Next.js cache and rebuilding
   - Checking for and updating any dependencies that might be causing conflicts
   - Adding Replit-specific environment configurations
   - Modifying webpack configuration if needed

The error seems to be happening during the module resolution phase of webpack, specifically with React Server Components, as indicated by references to 'react-server-dom-webpack' in the stack trace.

Please provide specific steps I can take to resolve this issue in the Replit environment while maintaining functionality in external browsers."

This prompt focuses on the specific webpack/module loading error you're seeing in Replit's Webview and provides context about the different behavior between Replit's Webview and external browsers. It directs the agent to look for Replit-specific issues and compatibility problems with Next.js and React Server Components, which appear to be at the heart of this particular error.
