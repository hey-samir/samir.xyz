      <p className="text-xl mb-4">I drive business impact at fintechs.</p>

        Today, I am leading Finance & Strategy for the Financial Partnerships team at <a href="https://cash.app/" className="text-[#482a83] hover:underline">Cash App</a> where we're expanding financial access to help users do more with their money. Previously I built Strategic Finance at <a href="https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/" className="text-[#482a83] hover:underline">HRT</a> which uses algorithms to drive efficiency in markets. Before that I was at <a href="https://www.unit.co/" className="text-[#482a83] hover:underline">Unit</a>, which embeds financial features into products. Prior to that, I built and led the Strategic Finance function at <a href="https://www.chime.com/" className="text-[#482a83] hover:underline">Chime</a>. Earlier, I was the first finance hire at <a href="https://sift.com/" className="text-[#482a83] hover:underline">Sift</a>. I got my start in investment banking in the Financial Institutions Group at <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/investment-banking" className="text-[#482a83] hover:underline">JP Morgan</a> covering market structure and asset management.
