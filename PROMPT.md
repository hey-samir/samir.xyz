# Current Project State and Next Steps

## Project Overview
Personal portfolio website showcasing professional projects through an AI-enhanced interactive design that dynamically highlights technical expertise and professional achievements.

## Current State
- Successfully migrated to Next.js 13.4.19 with React 18.2.0
- Implemented basic project structure with proper component organization
- Set up development environment with start-dev.sh script
- Added kill-port package for port management
- Version 1.1.9 with simplified server configuration

## Technical Debt and Immediate Needs
1. Workflow Configuration
   - Need to properly set up continuous development workflow
   - Current workflow setup is incomplete and needs proper configuration
   - Port management needs improvement

2. Error Handling
   - Implement proper error handling for port conflicts
   - Add health checks for the Next.js server
   - Improve development server stability

3. Infrastructure
   - Verify all asset paths are working correctly
   - Ensure proper handling of environment variables
   - Set up proper development server configuration

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Configure proper workflow for continuous development
   - Set up Next.js development server workflow
   - Implement proper port management
   - Add health check endpoints

2. Improve error handling and monitoring
   - Add error boundaries to React components
   - Implement proper logging
   - Add monitoring for development server

3. Clean up and optimize
   - Verify all asset paths
   - Clean up unused dependencies
   - Optimize build configuration

## Important Notes
- Do not modify .replit or replit.nix files directly
- Use packager_install_tool for dependency management
- The application runs on port 5000
- Use start-dev.sh for development server startup
- Keep version tracking in CHANGELOG.md

## Development Guidelines
- Follow the established Next.js + React pattern
- Maintain TypeScript type safety
- Use the provided tools for all installations and configurations
- Keep the clean, minimal design aesthetic
